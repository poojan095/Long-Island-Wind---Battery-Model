# Long-Island-Wind---Battery-Model
This project is an investigation into the average demand for electricity in 3 neighborhoods(East Hampton, Bridge Hampton and Amagansett) of Long Island for the future potential of wind/solar/battery integration. This project will further lead to optimization of the renewable sizing and resource planning for optimal costs and minimum environment impact.
